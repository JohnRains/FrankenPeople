In 2013, working for Cane Bay Partners, I needed lots of fake data to populate a vast amount of user data in a loan management system;so I wrote my own which used vast
amounts of correlated data via MS SQL stored procedures. These SPs were used in a VB.Net desktop application to form the payload for an XML post. Later in 2015, I wrapped 
the SPs in C# classes for use in a continuous Automation QA test suite.

I left Cane Bay Partners and, looking for a similar solution, came across Bogus and I threw together this solution to test the capabilities. 

I claim no rights to the solution.
